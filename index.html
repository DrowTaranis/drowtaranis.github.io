    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Oliver Clay and I'm learning to code.</p>
    <p>Previously I worked as a local news journalist for around 15 years: a career which included one regional award win, another nomination, and regular contributions to a famous award-winning regional title, as well as occasional bylines for national titles.</p>
    <p>Despite a passion for journalism, it was time for a change.</p>
    <p>On they surface they might seem very different pursuits but there's definitely a certain overlap in combining creativity with practicality.</p>
    <p>My fairly rudimentary self-taught coding skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C# and XML using WPF, have now progressed to a more formal footing, having recently embarked on a full-stack traineeship.</p>
<p>Prior to starting the course, I'd published four websites including three simple games and a spoof 'AI' bot, and written a more advanced game, although sadly this is yet to see the light of day beyond myself as my efforts to settle on a brand name continue.</p>
<p>Although hopes can be a fickle ally, I love the outdoors and often dream of getting away somewhere to live as an environmentally-friendly rustic hermit with an assortment of pets and rescue animals, maybe somewhere in range of the sound of the sea and hiking-distance of green and rainy hills and valleys.</p>
<p>It might be that the route to such a place isn't A to B, but more A to B via 'C' (as in C#, and other languages).</p>
<p>I'm based in the North West of England.</p>
<p>Feel free to have a look around the site.</p>
