    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Codecademy project: Mixed Messages. For this I chose to create a random alien greeting generator. Stored on Github. Feel free to give it a go <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DrowTaranis/MixedMessages"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The registered trademarks are registered for the UK.</p>
    <p><strong>Games</strong></p>
<p>Please bear in mind I wrote, illustrated and coded these before starting the coding course and there are definitely things I'd do differently now, including some responsive design and sprucing up the GDPR box.</p>
    <p><em>Election Run®</em> is a politics-themed game in which players pick a candidate to play and run for election using a simple random card system. <a href="https://electionrun.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Play it here.</strong></a></p>    
<p><em>FameGrafter®</em>  was inspired by the ZX Spectrum Codemasters Classic 'Rockstar Ate My Hamster' and puts the player in the hotseat of a talent agency, assigning his performers to a different project each week in the worlds of film, music and more. The random show name generator actually works quite well. <a target="_blank" href="https://famegrafter.com/"><strong>Play it here.</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Artificial Untelligence®</em> was an attempt to ease my unease over the rapid rise of AI in the form of a very basic spoof, featuring an image generator, horoscopes, unhelpful therapist and unhelpful support chatbot, all working off simple random generators. <a href="https://artificialuntelligence.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Give it a go here.</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Arachnospiracy: The Halton Fear™</em> is a very simple text-based adventure game and something of a protest at some of the clustered poor-quality public realm and dereliction. <a href="https://arachnospiracy.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Play it here.</strong></a></p>
<p>I've also written a game that I'm hoping to publish as a standalone download purchase once I've settled on a better general brand name. At the moment it's working title is <em>Project V</em>.</p>
<p>If anyone would be interested in developing any of the games as a commercial project and making an offer, collaborating or hiring, get in touch. No dodgy characters.</p>
